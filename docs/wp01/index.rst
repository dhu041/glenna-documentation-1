Cloud Storage
===================

-----------------------------------------------
Integration
-----------------------------------------------

- Integration of storage facility in federated resources (Kalmar2). Tailored access through Glenna portal or equiv.
- Identity management and accounting/billing according to Glenna scheme.
- EUDAT2020 collaboration: B2Drop technology transfer and followup.

---------------------------------------------------------
Performance
---------------------------------------------------------

- Performance optimization.
- By horizontal scaling (sharding) obtain improved bandwidth and lower latency.

---------------------------------------------
Evaluation of staging
---------------------------------------------

- Evaluation of techniques for staging to Glenna compute resources.
- Evaluation of techniques for enhanced access to resources and seamless integration through identity recognition, authentication and automated data transfer pre and post computation.

-----------------------
Subsystem evaluation
-----------------------

- Performance measurements.
- Effects of sharding and other means of scaling.
